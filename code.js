/***********CONSTRUCTOR PART EXPLAINATION************/

The above^ code defines two classes: Node and LinkedList.

1. Node Class:

The Node class represents an individual node in a singly linked list. Each node has two properties:

1ST PROPERTY(each constructor property is defined w/ a dot('.')) => .data =  This property stores the actual data or value that the node holds.
2ND PROPERTY(each constructor property is defined w/ a dot('.')) => .next = This property is a reference to the next node in the linked list. Initially, it's set to 'null' because when a node is created, it doesn't have a next node yet.

2. LinkedList Class:

The LinkedList class represents the linked list itself. It has one property:

PROPERTY(the constructor property is defined w/ a dot('.')) => .head = This property is a reference to the first node (the head) of the linked list. Initially, it's set to 'null' because when you create an empty linked list, there are no nodes in it.

SHORTEN EXPLANATION for the 2 classes:

The 'Node' class is used to create individual nodes with data and a reference to the next node, and the 'LinkedList' class is used to manage these nodes as a linked list, with the head property pointing to the first node.

    }

/***********APPEND method PART EXPLAINATION************/
/*

1. 'append(data)' is a method used to add a new node with the provided data to the end (tail) of the linked list.

2. Inside the method, we first create a new node called 'newNode' using the 'Node' class constructor. This new node will hold the data we want to add to the linked list.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/tXRT22_IGlQh

3. Next, we check if the linked list is empty, which is indicated by the 'head' property being 'null'. If it's empty, we make the 'head' of the linked list point to the 'newNode'. This means that the new node becomes the first and only node in the list.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/Kh0uNRur9DVg

4. If the linked list is not empty, meaning there are already nodes in the list, we need to find the current last node (the one whose 'next' property is 'null') and make its 'next' property point to the 'newNode'. We do this by starting at the 'head' of the list and traversing it until we find the last node.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/hedoFdsv8QtC

üö∂üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èHere's the step-by-step process of the code block...

1Ô∏è‚É£ We start with current pointing to the head.
2Ô∏è‚É£ We enter a loop that continues as long as current has a next node (i.e., it's not the last node).
3Ô∏è‚É£ In each iteration of the loop, we move current to the next node by setting current equal to current.next. This effectively moves us one step closer to the end of the list.
4Ô∏è‚É£ When we reach the last node (i.e., current.next is null), we exit the loop.
üèÜ Finally, we set the next property of the last node (which is now current) to point to the newNode, effectively adding it to the end of the list.

SHORTEN EXPLANATION of the append method:

In short, the append(data) method checks if the list is empty and adds the new node as the first node if it is. If the list is not empty, it traverses the list to find the last node and attaches the new node to it to maintain the order of nodes in the list. This ensures that the new data is added to the end of the linked list.

/***********POP method PART EXPLAINATION************/
/*

1. First, the method checks if the linked list is empty by examining whether 'this.head' is 'null'. If it's empty, there's nothing to pop, so it returns 'null'.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/v3XLaQ-h5ASY

2. If there's only one node in the linked list (i.e., 'this.head.next' is 'null'), it means that this node is both the first and last node in the list. In this case, it stores a reference to this node in the 'popped' variable, sets 'this.head' to 'null' to make the list empty, and finally returns the 'popped' node.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/635SYAYHYae-

3. If there are more than one node in the linked list, it enters the 'else' block. It uses a 'while' loop to traverse the list to find the second-to-last node. The loop continues until 'current.next.next' is 'null', which means 'current' is pointing to the second-to-last node in the list.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/5JKF1KiVZktf

4. It then stores a reference to the last node in the 'popped' variable. To remove the last node from the list, it sets the next of the second-to-last node (pointed to by 'current') to 'null', effectively disconnecting it from the last node.

SEE SCREENSHOT: https://prnt.sc/eoaZ10P7H_lR

5. Finally, it returns the 'popped' node, which is the last node that was removed from the list.

2. 'const newNode = new Node(data);' creates a new node with the specified 'data'. This node will be the new head of the linked list.

1. popFirst() is designed to remove and return the first node from the linked list. It's sometimes referred to as "shift" in the context of linked lists.

2. ImplementationüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª:

- The method starts by checking if the linked list is empty. If the head of the list is null, it means there are no nodes in the list. In this case, the method returns null to indicate that there's nothing to remove.
- If the list is not empty, it proceeds to remove the first node from the list.
- It does this by storing the current head node in a variable called popped. This node will be returned as the result.
- Next, the head is updated to point to the second node in the list, effectively removing the first node. This is done by assigning this.head to this.head.next.
- Finally, the method returns the popped node, which contains the data from the node that was removed.

3. SAMPLE:

ü§îImagine you have a linked list with nodes containing the values 1, 2, and 3. If you call popFirst() on this list, it will remove the node with the value 1 from the front of the list and return it. After this operation, the list will contain the nodes 2 and 3.

const myList = new LinkedList();
myList.append(1);
